We will be creating a financial management website offering 5 different calculators
for mortgage payments, car payments, debt repayment, leisure spending (vacation or
personal), and a calculator for retirement age. Other features will include: options
to log in, graphical and textual data representation, a spending tracker, and setting
local currency. Our website will provide a personalized and user-friendly experience
designed particularly for the younger generations dealing with ever-changing markets
and skyrocketing interest rates. Our stakeholder is Trinity Munro who is interested
in the functionality of the multipurpose calculator. We plan to implement this website
using React, Node.js, SQL, and maybe Cloud Run and Docker.
